# forumslader-enhancements
Some modifications I'm making to my Forumslader rectifier for bicycle dynamos

Upgrades to forumslader controller- esp, see hans & sven's email- 

# Ideas
- Blinkenlights
  - 12v light output should have a blink option
  - spec and buy MOSFET
  - write code to control mosfet from GPIO
  - see low power circuit (attached, load into script from https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html)
- CSCS GATT profile, to allow Strava, etc to receive high quality speed data via BT
- May be used to power (and control?) Electronic shifting project
- upgrade to marine grade cables & connectors
